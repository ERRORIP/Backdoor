### Overview

This project is a stealthy PHP file manager and backdoor that provides covert system access and file management functionality through a simple web interface. It allows you to browse directories, upload, edit, download, rename, move, compress, and delete files. In addition, it features a built-in terminal emulator and a host information page. A unique lock mechanism is also provided to restrict access.

### Key Features

- **Directory Browsing & File Listing**  
  - Displays current directories with detailed information such as modification time, file size (or "-" for folders), owner/group, and permissions.  
  - Uses a responsive, minimalist design based on flexbox for file lists.

- **File Operations**  
  - **View / Edit:** Open files directly in the browser using [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) for syntax highlighting.  
  - **Download:** Forces file downloads (even HTML files) by reading files in binary mode with proper HTTP headers.  
  - **Rename, Move & Delete:** Easily perform file operations through a contextual dropdown (three-dot menu) for each file.  
  - **Compress:** Create ZIP archives of files or directories for easy transfer and backup.

- **Upload Functionality**  
  - Supports file uploads with the ability to choose a target directory.  
  - Offers a text input to specify a custom target directory if needed.

- **Terminal Emulator**  
  - **Xterm.js Integration:** A built-in web terminal that lets you execute basic commands on the server with live output.  

- **Host Information**  
  - Displays comprehensive server details including OS, PHP version, server IP, disk space, and more in a clean, tabular layout.

- **Lock Mechanism**  
  - Toggle a built-in lock feature to restrict access via a password prompt.  
  - Lock state and password are stored in the browser‚Äôs localStorage (for demonstration purposes only).

- **Covert & Stealth Features**  
  - Incorporates graphical effects like a "Matrix Effect" to hide the tool‚Äôs true nature.  
  - Uses dark themes and minimalist design for a professional, stealthy appearance.  
  - Can be used as a backdoor for covert access in testing environments (Note: Unauthorized use is illegal).

### Technical Details & Analysis

#### How It Works:
- **PHP & File System:**  
  Utilizes standard PHP functions (e.g., `scandir()`, `filemtime()`, `filesize()`) and POSIX functions (if available) to access file metadata.
  
- **Forced File Download:**  
  Sends proper HTTP headers and reads files in binary mode (`rb`) in chunks to ensure proper download behavior.
  
- **File Editing with CodeMirror:**  
  Provides an in-browser editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and more.
  
- **Web Terminal with Xterm.js:**  
  Offers a live terminal emulator for executing basic server commands.
  
- **Lock Mechanism:**  
  Implements a simple lock feature via JavaScript using modal dialogs and stores the password in localStorage (not secure for production).

#### Backdoor Analysis:
- **Broad Access:**  
  Enables full file management (view, edit, delete, etc.) and basic command execution, which can be powerful if misused.
  
- **Stealth Design:**  
  Uses graphical effects and a dark, minimal interface to hide its true nature and blend in.
  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  Due to its powerful capabilities, it must be used only in controlled, authorized environments. The localStorage lock is for demonstration and not a production-level security solution.

### Usage & Deployment

1. **Deploy:**  
   Upload the PHP file to your server with the correct permissions.
   
2. **Access:**  
   Open the script in your browser to access the file manager, upload, terminal, host info, and lock pages.
   
3. **Lock:**  
   Toggle the lock feature by clicking the "Lock Off" button and set a password to restrict access.
   
4. **File Operations:**  
   Use the dropdown menu (three dots) next to each file or folder to view, edit, rename, move, compress, or delete files.
   
5. **Terminal & Upload:**  
   Execute simple commands via the integrated terminal or upload files as needed.
